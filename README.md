# JSON2CSV

Built with TS and React, mostly playing around with TypeScript.

Based off idea [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas)

TO DO List (probably won't get around to it):
- Bonus Features
  - Loading in a JSON file
  - Saving a CSV file
  - Converting [CSV to JSON](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/CSV2JSON-App.md)
- Improve the UI and style
- Maybe setup a cicd pipeline and deploy using GH actions/pages
- Playwright test (might be overkill)
